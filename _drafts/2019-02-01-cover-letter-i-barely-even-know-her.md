I think the number one strategy is applying to a ton of jobs. High volume is by far the best strategy. The first time after my data science bootcamp, I applied to over 300 places and only interviewed on-site at 5 or 6, and in the end, only got an offer at 2. Your rejection rate will be 98%. Even after 2 years of work experience, I was still at a 95% rejection rate. In the end, the only thing I regret is not applying in greater volume. Remember, them not accepting you is the norm, and there is no way around that.

Tied to that, you just have to apply. If you're still writing cover letters, you need to cut back significantly. Out of all the positions I've applied to, only 1 company out of 500+ has ever mentioned my cover letter when talking to a real decision maker, and from all the interviewing processes I've seen, no real decision maker is given your cover letter because they're mostly fluff. I would say at most 10% of applications should have a customized cover letter, 30% get a stock cover letter with some minor adjustments. Writing cover letters massively slows down your application process, grinding your applications to a halt.

I would say the kind of jobs you're applying to sounds like a good plan, although I would emphasize more on the less technical role. I know there are plenty of smaller companies in NYC that will take people with less experience but with less pay. If you're only applying to big companies, that's definitely something you need to expand your horizons on. If you know some coding and database design, you should be a fairly desirable candidate for analyst roles.

In addition, I'm unsure how your resume looks, but I get a gut feeling that you may need to go more in-depth or work on a side project to bulk up your resume, or maybe just clean it up and put it in a more standardized format and the right keywords.
