# LJamesHuSite: Portfolio / Blog site for James Hu

Built off the great work from Mediumish with some significant features and editing to fit my preferences.

**Mediumish for Jekyll** is designed and developed by [Sal](https://www.wowthemes.net) and it is *free* under MIT license. 

Quick refresher for myself whenever I need to update this thing:

1. cd into folder, `git pull`
2. Perform necessary file updates
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`; gitignore should ignore extraneous files, if jekyll not installed, install it.
4. Upload to github, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Update x"`, `git push origin master`
