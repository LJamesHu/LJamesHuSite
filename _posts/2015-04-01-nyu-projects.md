In my four years as an undergrad at New York University, I have taken a wide variety of classes that have given me broad business knowledge and skills. These are an overall set of worthwhile or interesting projects from my time at New York University that show analysis, research skills, writing skills, and proficiency across multiple business areas.

Two projects stand out in particular as being analytical and very business focused.

## Smuckers Case Study

This was a two week case study for PriceWaterhouseCoopers Industry Analysis Consulting Case Competition. The goal was to outline the strategic challenges and opportunities of a selected Fortune 500 company and come up with a plan to move the company forward.

Initially we were undecided and needed to identify key Fortune 500 companies that we thought had strong potential. To do this, we had to parse the list of Fortune 500 companies for potential opportunities. Unfortunately the Fortune 500 data was locked up in an inaccessible form, paginated, and difficult read, analyze, or sort any aspects of the company, even though the information was there. So one of the first things I did was organize the Fortune 500 into more manipulable CSV format to allow for better analysis than the current Fortune 500 site.

To simplify this, I created a script in Python with the BeautifulSoup library to scrape all the data in the site, then put it into a csv format. This made the data accessible and manipulable for analysis.

For our company, we chose J.M. Smuckers and came up with a comprehensive and innovative plan to drive sales through Smuckers’ core values.

## Sovereign Bank Risk Study

This study was the final project for the class Risk Management in Financial Institutions.

The interesting part about this was how it took many of the concepts that we learned in class and applied them in a real life scenario. After taking data from the FDIC website, we had to process and apply strategies and our knowledge to the data to obtain a reasonable analysis of the bank.

The project required a thorough analysis covering various risk exposures such as liquidity and credit risk, capital adequacy measures, profitability, and risk management tools that were being used. These gave interesting insights into the bank and also were doubly interesting in how they revealed the rather jarring changes due to the financial crisis in 2008.
