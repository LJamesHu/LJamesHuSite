Hello World Version 2: Electric Boogaloo

This is basically marking the relaunch of the site. Given that Wordpress site felt a little outdated in terms of design, structure, and my own ability to customize it, I decided to move towards a Jekyll solution hosted on Github Pages. Part test, part just fun project to revamp and possibly make a real blog that I can be proud of.
